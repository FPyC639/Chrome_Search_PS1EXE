# Chrome_Search_PS1EXE

In this PowerShell application using Windows Form I was able to generate a Graphical User Interface that when inputted urls search for them in Google Chrome browser.

For example:

## Test Values

https://www.bing.com

https://www.google.com

https://www.bing.com/search?q="America Short hair cats"

https://www.google.com/search?q="Puss in Boots"

These URLs allow you navigate to the websites you desire.

Additional desire would be to create a search CLI inteface that allows one to input the query into a search engine of choice allowing users to choose the website of choice.
